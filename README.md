# ConnectTel-Customer-Churn-Prediction


## Overview
This repository contains the code and dataset for a customer churn prediction project. The goal is to develop a robust customer churn prediction system using advanced analytics and machine learning techniques. The project aims to accurately forecast customer churn and implement targeted retention initiatives based on the insights derived from the provided dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset includes information about customer demographics, services, contract details, and churn status. The data is used to train machine learning models for predicting customer churn.

## Steps Taken
1. **Data Cleaning and Exploration:**
   - Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset.
   - Explored the distribution of variables and identified patterns.

2. **Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate Analysis:**
   - Conducted univariate and bivariate analysis to understand individual variable characteristics.
   - Performed multivariate analysis to explore relationships between variables and identify potential predictors of churn.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Converted categorical variables into numerical representations.
   - Created new features and applied feature scaling to enhance model performance.

4. **Supervised Learning Models:**
   - Trained and tested three supervised learning models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier.
   - Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

5. **Challenges Faced:**
   - Addressed imbalances in the dataset to ensure fair model evaluation.
   - Tuned hyperparameters to optimize model performance.
   - Considered trade-offs between false positives and false negatives based on business priorities.

## Future Work
- Explore additional machine learning models and ensemble methods.
- Fine-tune hyperparameters for improved model accuracy.
- Implement real-time monitoring of model performance and customer churn patterns.
